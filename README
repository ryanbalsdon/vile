Vile: ASCII Art Generator


 Vile is a simple ASCII-art generator that uses VT100 commands to draw
to a terminal. On Linux, the standard terminals are all fast enough to
do real-time animations but the default OSX terminal is a bit too slow.
For all of my Linux command-line tools though, I use this library to
put together 1-second long splash screens for them.

 The software (both vile.py and the test cases) are provided as public
domain works but the images are not.

 Please keep in mind that the tests are the absolute worst shapes to be 
trying to do this on. It'll work best on simple, very high-contrast shapes 
where these are thin and detailed.

 For a quick demonstration on how to display a single image, see
vile-test-bsf-static.py

 To go to the next level, see a demo on how to animate a few images
together here: vile-test-bsf.py
